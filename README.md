Configurations &amp; scripts to unify my development workflow across Windows, MacOS, and Arch.

## Quick Start

After cloning this repository, run the setup script to install git hooks:

```bash
./setup-git-hooks.sh
```

This installs a pre-commit hook that prevents accidental commits of secrets (API keys, tokens, etc.). See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed documentation.
